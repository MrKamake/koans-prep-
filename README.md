# Javascript Koans

Based on Edgecase's fantastic
[Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans), the goal of the
Javascript koans is to teach you Javascript programming through
testing.

When you first run the koans, you'll be presented with a runtime error and a
stack trace indicating where the error occurred. Your goal is to make the
error go away. As you fix each error, you should learn something about the
Javascript language and functional programming in general.

Your journey towards Javascript enlightenment starts in the koans/AboutExpects.js file. These
koans will be very simple, so don't overthink them! As you progress through
more koans, more and more Javascript syntax will be introduced which will allow
you to solve more complicated problems and use more advanced techniques.

## Running the Koans

Simply navigate to the Javascript Koans folder using a file browser, and
double click on KoansRunnner.html.

Javascript Koans 폴더로 이동하여 `KoansRunner.html` 파일을 실행시켜주세요.

Any browser will do, but for the best results Firefox or Chrome is
recommended. More stack trace information shows up for javascript on these
browsers.

브라우저는 크게 관계없지만, 크롬이나 파이어폭스를 권장합니다.

The first error will be in koans/AboutExpects.js. Fix the first test and
refresh the browser. Rinse and repeat until all tests turn green.

첫번째 에러는 `koans/AboutExpects.js`에서 발생합니다. 첫번째 에러가 발생한 부분을 찾아 수정한 후, 브라우저를 새로고침해주세요. 이와 같은 방식으로 주어진 테스트들을 모두 통과시키면 이번 과제는 종료됩니다.

The test runner used is [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) with a customized report viewer.

테스트 작성에는 [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)이라는 라이브러리가 사용되었습니다.
